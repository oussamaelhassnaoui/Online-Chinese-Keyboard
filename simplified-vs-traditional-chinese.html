            <h2>Understanding Simplified and Traditional Chinese Characters</h2>
            <p>Chinese characters exist in two major forms: Simplified and Traditional. Understanding the differences between these writing systems is essential for anyone learning Chinese or working with Chinese text.</p>
            
            <h3>Traditional Chinese Characters</h3>
            <p>Traditional Chinese characters are the original forms of Chinese characters that have been used for thousands of years. They are characterized by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More complex stroke structures</li>
                <li>Preservation of historical and etymological information</li>
                <li>Used primarily in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau</li>
                <li>Considered more aesthetically pleasing by many</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Simplified Chinese Characters</h3>
            <p>Simplified Chinese characters were officially introduced by the People's Republic of China in the 1950s to increase literacy rates. They are characterized by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced number of strokes</li>
                <li>Easier to write and learn</li>
                <li>Used primarily in Mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia</li>
                <li>Standardized by the Chinese government</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Key Differences</h3>
            <p>Here are some examples of how the same character looks in Traditional and Simplified forms:</p>
